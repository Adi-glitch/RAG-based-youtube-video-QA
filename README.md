As a huge anime geek, I've always loved diving into fan theories on YouTube, exploring different perspectives from various creators. However, watching lengthy videos can often be tedious and inefficient when you're just looking for specific pieces of information.

To solve this, I've built a Q&A system that extracts relevant answers directly from the video's transcript using a retrieval-based approach. This system allows you to quickly get accurate, context-specific answers without having to sit through the entire video or deal with out-of-context responses.

By combining automatic transcription (via Whisper) and a retrieval-based QA model, this project helps streamline the process of consuming content from lengthy videos, providing concise, relevant answers to your queries.
