His body dissolves as these seconds pass, leaving behind a chunk of flesh that has yet to dissipate on the ground. Meanwhile, Anosuke lies elsewhere unwilling to accept his treatment calmly. He chomps on a Kakashi member's hand to the point of blood, convincing the others taking care of him that he'll be just fine. However, that's when he also spews out blood from his boar mask and they start to doubt that he'll be okay after all. Not far from there, Zenitsu dramatically requests the Kakashi let his wife know that he loves her, his wife Nezuko that is, adding that she should be made aware of how bravely he fought while thinking of her. The core members can't help but say, this guy never shuts up, but that's where the comedy ends. Gyu wanders around looking for Tanjiro, while the Kakashi try to calm him down so they can treat his deep injuries, including his lost arm. But before they can pull him away, he notices Tanjiro's slumped body. Kneeling on the ground, with his hand still slightly holding his sword despite having no life left in his body, the Kakashi around Tanjiro look on in sorrow, tears spilling from their eyes, and Gyu can't help but do the same, remembering the bright, kind boy that fought so hard to get his sister's life back to normal. At almost the same time that Gyu drops down, leaning his head against Tanjiro's, blaming himself for not protecting this young boy, Nezuko arrives. But this isn't the end, far from it. Before we see how the few remaining Slayers handle this situation, make sure to drop a like and subscribe to Plot Armor with notifications on to let us know you want to see more high quality videos like this. The King of Demons is how it is revealed that a part of Muzan, deep within himself and attached to Tanjiro, still lives. We enter a small flashback showing a baby Muzan looking much like his final form, and long, black arms reaching for him within his mother's womb, trying to pluck his life from him. When Muzan was born, he had no pulse and was not breathing, reflecting the state that Tanjiro is currently in. However, because Muzan was thought to be dead at birth, they began the preparations to cremate him, if only they had gone through with it. Before they started the fire, Muzan finally moved about, crying for his life to not be cut short. Admittedly, Muzan's life force remained strong for most of his life, allowing him the freedom to do as he wished. The only obstacle was his son, and people like Ubiashiki and those who worked under him persistently tried to cut Muzan down and send him to the flames of hell, rather than cremation. With little memory of his victims, Muzan believes, flesh dies, and that is the end. But their feelings, those pesky things stayed behind, lingered, and held on so tightly that they pulled Muzan down into ruin. And yet, because he learned from them, even shedding tears for the strength of their will, he wants to now do the same for himself with his dying breath. As his clawed fingers reach out for a fading Tanjiro, he intends to leave his wishes and hopes with him, knowing the young boy's body has not fully died just yet, unlike his own. Muzan roughly grabs Tanjiro by the throat, but not to kill, to sink his fingers deep within his flesh and fill him with his own powers and blood, passing on the abilities to become something stronger. With that and all of Tanjiro's strengths and techniques, he will surpass Muzan himself and become the King of the Demons. And that, because he not only can overcome the dangers of sunlight, but because he knows sun breathing. With that, we return to the devastating Gyu kneeling in front of Tanjiro and the Kakushi standing around them. One of the crying members rubs his eyes and notices something is off. The large chunk of flesh that had been covering Tanjiro's eye is slowly shifting away. Tanjiro's eyes snap open, and the color matches that of Muzan's. He is no longer himself. Before the Kakushi can let Gyu know, Tanjiro's arm is regrown in a flash, completely unharmed. Tanjiro attempts to slash at the nearby core members, but even courting death, Gyu quickly gets the Kakushi away with his body. As the next Kakushi, standing behind a wild, snarling Tanjiro, is too shocked to move. Gyu screams for them to get back! With the sun having now climbed over the horizon, it shines brighter now than when Muzan died. This demonic Tanjiro notices it, but he has nothing to cover his body save for his arms, which start to catch fire. His skin ablaze, growling like a beast at the pain, the Kakushi who was aiming to attack survives with just a scratch across their nose and their face covering cut free. As always, the quick reacting Gyu tells them to move away because they are too shocked by what is happening. Wasn't the battle over? Wasn't Muzan killed? Tanjiro, still groaning and screaming in pain because of the sun charring his flesh, is distracted enough that Gyu shouts for anyone who is able and alive to come face this new threat. From a corner, Yushiro cannot believe what he is hearing. He knows Muzan has died. Likewise, a bandaged Nitsu whose hearing allows him to notice the commotion, wonders what is happening since he is too far to see it. The Kakushi around Sanemi also hear Gyu's cries for support, but the wind Ashira is unconscious from his injuries and cannot lend a hand. When Gyu finally says, Tanjiro has become a demon, the look of horror on the faces of both Nitsu and Inosuke could stop time. The water Ashira keeps shouting, announcing that they have no choice but to try and burn him in the sun before he kills them all. As Tanjiro's body continues smoking from the daylight, he decides to flee with a strong push towards a dark shelter which would stop the pain. But before he can reach it, Gyu tackles him, piercing him in the side with his sword to prevent him from reaching the shaded area. Wild and angry, Tanjiro grips Gyu by the hair with his clawed fingers, new wounds slicing across Gyu's face as he cries. But it's not the pain that hurts him the most, it's the fact that his friend has become this creature that he would have never wanted to be. A fanged and snarling Tanjiro suddenly stops burning as he looks down at Gyu. The singed flesh, no longer hurting him, begins to heal as he uses that instance to smash Gyu in the face with a closed fist. Taken by surprise and falling off balance, Gyu can't protect himself from the killing slice that is aiming for his head. In that moment, Inosuke arrives swinging his sword, screaming, what are you doing? Demonized Tanjiro jumps back at the attack, but Gyu trying to gather his bearings from the extra blood loss he has suffered. Inosuke places himself in front of Gyu, protecting him from any more damage, with Zenitsu shouting Tanjiro's name in the distance as well. At this, Tanjiro drops down like a wild animal, his claws on full display and ready to pounce on whomever he chooses next. His red eyes burn with hunger, while the slayer mark covers most of his face. Zenitsu continues to call his name, softer each time and more upset at what his friend has turned into. Even though he is still dealing with the shock of the situation, Inosuke refuses to leave Gyu unprotected and spreads his arms when Tanjiro leaps at him like a vicious beast. They swing at each other, Inosuke using both swords to fend off Tanjiro's elongated nails, but he easily gets knocked back. The overwhelming emotions begin to flood Inosuke's memories as he pictures all the times they ate together, trained together, and promised to stay on the right path. They had agreed that if one of them did not follow their code, they would have to stop them. They promised. Inosuke knows that was the deal, but even so, he can only see the kindness that Tanjiro has always had for him. The beast snarling and aggressive, nothing like Tanjiro, is almost at his face and he cannot raise his swords to defend himself. Tears slip through the boar mask as he watches them in the end approaching, unable to hurt someone who has always been the best person to him. Let's go home. At the very last moment, Zenitsu and Gyu look on in horror. Nezuko arrives, grabbing onto her brother to keep him from injuring his friend. She hugs her big brother tightly, desperate for him to regain his gentleness, his warmth as a person. Rather than blaming him for this mishap, she is all too understanding and grief-stricken by how many hardships Tanjiro has been forced to face. This demonification is just another in a long line of nightmarish situations. She holds him close, tears sliding down her cheeks as she squeezes tighter, not understanding why this happens to people who struggle every day. Hoping she can get through to him, she reminds him that the worst is almost over and that he can overcome this just like all the other trials. He just needs to win once more and they can go home together. They can be at peace. But not seeming to care, Tanjiro unleashes a roar and digs his claws deep within her shoulder, trying to throw her aside. She clutches him too tightly to be removed though and Zenitsu jumps in to protect her body that Tanjiro tries to hurt further. Holding his forehead back, Zenitsu tries to keep Tanjiro's teeth from piercing Nezuko now that she has been returned to being a human. Still clinging to him, Nezuko buries her face in Tanjiro's chest while Zenitsu fights to keep him away from her, reminding him that she can speak again, that she called him brother. Finally out of his trance, Inosuke jumps in and whacks Tanjiro's head when he unleashes a vile growl. Just shut up already, shouts Inosuke, still crying and upset over this horrific turn of events. It was supposed to be easy once Muzan died. It was supposed to be over. He keeps punching Tanjiro, swinging his arms wildly with his emotions getting the better of him. But instead of getting through to Tanjiro, it sends him into a new state of anger as he snarls and destroys the ground near them, with chunks of concrete flying in all directions. Only Nezuko is left to hold him back. Zenitsu, Inosuke, and Gyu have been blown back with the intensity of the attack, and he bites into her. At this first taste of blood, Tanjiro hunkers down like a werewolf. Bone-like limbs suddenly explode from his body, whipping around to keep the slayers away from him. Meanwhile, Nezuko refuses to let go of him, eyes still filled with tears as he pants and attacks his friends with a newfound strength. Gyu rushes in when one of Tanjiro's limbs nearly kills Zenitsu, firing off his water-breathing, striking Tide attack. Knowing it is too late to recover Tanjiro now that he has consumed human blood, Gyu considers his options for defeating this impossibly strong demon. Sunlight and red blaze do not work, so what's left to use? As Tanjiro prepares a massive ball of energy with his mouth that would devastate the area and anyone nearby, Nezuko pleads and begs for him not to kill anyone, going as far as to put her hand in front of the attack. Thankfully, Gyu is able to move out of the way, with Zenitsu crying and shouting for the injury that Nezuko gained in the process. Despite wanting to end them all, Tanjiro's body doesn't seem to hold the same hostility for Nezuko, who argues and fights to keep another attack from being launched. Zenitsu pleads with Tanjiro to stop while Inosuke can only softly utter their names, having lost all his strength. This surprises Gyu who has been watching closely and notices that Tanjiro is not striking or biting Nezuko even though he easily could. Using another water breathing technique, Gyu hopes he can break through to Tanjiro and get his senses back, as hopeless as it seems. Yushiro cannot do anything but watch from afar because his son is out in full capacity and he would be dead in seconds. He can't believe Muzan is still causing this much trouble after death. Just then, a focused and zombie-like Hanao slowly makes her way to them, holding her injured side. Tears falling for the siblings and all they're going through, she approaches with the last of the demon antidote, enough to change one of them back to human. With one of her eyes lost to her technique, she contemplates the reason why she was left with one to use. And this must be the destined moment. Although Tanjiro is powerful, he is still a new demon and not able to control his powers well. Hanao uses that to her advantage, striking him with flower-breathing, equinoctial vermilion eye. Gyu spots her running at full speed towards his siblings and before Tanjiro can send her away, she strikes him with the attack, his fierce claws nearly stabbing her in the darkened eye. All he cuts instead are some strands of her hair as she leaps and launches herself over him, digging the medicine into his back. With his arm having slashed her chest as she went above him, she gently tells him to come back to us. Suddenly, a deep pang hits Tanjiro as his human self deep within thinks of Nezuko and what he is doing to her. Voices of encouragement. Seeing his true form finally, Tanjiro hears his younger sister's wishes for them to go back home now that the fight is over. But the flesh is overwhelming him, keeping him pinned down and unable to free himself. He is too tired to get away from Muzan's control on his own. He too begins to cry, praying for God to let him out of this mess so that he can go home. As he reaches a hand in the air, Muzan's demonic stare looks back at him from his outreached arm. The demon reminds Tanjiro about all the people who are dead, leaving no one left to return home to. But that does not deter Tanjiro, who finally remembers his family and the love they gave him when they were alive. Muzan tries the only trick he has left. He tells Tanjiro that he killed Nezuko. But even in this limbo-esque space, Tanjiro can tell he is lying. And the belief in that pushes him upwards, his deceased family also aiding to lift him away from Muzan's hold. But it is not enough to keep the demon at bay. He insists now that he has hurt his friends and comrades. That he'd be better off here and not going to see them because they hate him now. Regardless, Tanjiro insists he must make amends for what he has done. He needs to apologize to them face to face. And though Muzan tries to keep him down, he pushes through, smelling their worry even from here, and needing to see them again. At last, a full-bodied Muzan appears, his cold stare matching his words. Silence. You are the inheritor of my will. Not unlike the anger and aggression he used on his upper-ranked demons, Muzan tugs on Tanjiro's hair to get him to listen and obey his commands. But Tanjiro ignores his worries about dying due to manifesting the mark. His eyes are looking forward beyond Muzan. While the demon tells him to live forever, Tanjiro only wants to be human and die like anyone else. He wants to see and be with everyone he cares about. With more harsh words not only insulting Tanjiro but accusing him of being selfish, Tanjiro's will begins to chip away, tears falling from his eyes. He isn't alone though. Never. Not wanting him to give in, his fallen comrades, Rengoku, Gyomei, Genya, Muichiro, Shinobu, Obenai, and Kanroji prop him up and help lead him upwards encouraging him to be free of this tug of war. Finally, smelling wisteria and freedom so close that he can nearly touch it, two arms reach through and take hold of him from above. Tanjiro grasps that hand firmly, realizing it's Nezuko. Muzan's hold refuses to loosen though, gripping him by the head and body, trying to drag him back down. With a final push, Tanjiro knows he is doing the right thing despite all the others who lost their lives. They knew what their work entailed. They wanted to save others and risk themselves for that cause. If anything, they would want him to be happy now that he can be. Knowing he won't win, Muzan is but a torso clinging onto a rising Tanjiro, floating upwards as if going to heaven. More hands join Nezuko's, keeping Tanjiro on the right path, leading him to them and away from Muzan's desperate pleas for survival. With a final pull, Muzan can no longer reach him or get through to him, and Tanjiro feels as if surrounded by flower petals as he slowly opens his eyes. Once he can see, there are over a dozen people around him, including Nezuko at his side. The first word he hears is his name from his sister's lips, his now human sister. And seeing her injured, more than anything pushes Tanjiro to tears as he apologizes for hurting her. Everyone suddenly cheers at that. Tanjiro is back to normal. Inosuke blubbers next to him trying to put on a brave face when it is clear how worried he was from the tears slipping through his mask. A moment later, Zenitsu vows to make Tanjiro pay for hurting his wife, which clearly catches Nezuko off guard. Gyu wobbles in place as the relief overcomes his body, and his injuries catch up with him. A beautifully touching embrace is shared between the siblings as they begin to cry, but with happiness this time around. Nearby, Kanao is informed about the medicine having worked and turned Tanjiro back to normal. She watches Tanjiro with tears in her eyes as he smiles back, with Inosuke clinging to him like a child. And you know what? Yushiro could not hold back his tears either, so glad for Tanjiro's return, but also carrying a great sadness for Tamayo's loss as he cradles her pin. At last, it is over. For real this time. As always, I'm Slice of Otaku. Thank you all so much for watching and have an awesome day.

Thankfully, Gyu is able to move out of the way, with Zenitsu crying and shouting for the injury that Nezuko gained in the process. Despite wanting to end them all, Tanjiro's body doesn't seem to hold the same hostility for Nezuko, who argues and fights to keep another attack from being launched. Zenitsu pleads with Tanjiro to stop while Inosuke can only softly utter their names, having lost all his strength. This surprises Gyu who has been watching closely and notices that Tanjiro is not striking or biting Nezuko even though he easily could. Using another water breathing technique, Gyu hopes he can break through to Tanjiro and get his senses back, as hopeless as it seems. Yushiro cannot do anything but watch from afar because his son is out in full capacity and he would be dead in seconds. He can't believe Muzan is still causing this much trouble after death. Just then, a focused and zombie-like Hanao slowly makes her way to them, holding her injured side. Tears falling for the siblings and all they're going through, she approaches with the last of the demon antidote, enough to change one of them back to human. With one of her eyes lost to her technique, she contemplates the reason why she was left with one to use. And this must be the destined moment. Although Tanjiro is powerful, he is still a new demon and not able to control his powers well. Hanao uses that to her advantage, striking him with flower-breathing, equinoctial vermilion eye. Gyu spots her running at full speed towards his siblings and before Tanjiro can send her away, she strikes him with the attack, his fierce claws nearly stabbing her in the darkened eye. All he cuts instead are some strands of her hair as she leaps and launches herself over him, digging the medicine into his back. With his arm having slashed her chest as she went above him, she gently tells him to come back to us. Suddenly, a deep pang hits Tanjiro as his human self deep within thinks of Nezuko and what he is doing to her. Voices of encouragement. Seeing his true form finally, Tanjiro hears his younger sister's wishes for them to go back home now that the fight is over. But the flesh is overwhelming him, keeping him pinned down and unable to free himself. He is too tired to get away from Muzan's control on his own. He too begins to cry, praying for God to let him out of this mess so that he can go home. As he reaches a hand in the air, Muzan's demonic stare looks back at him from his outreached arm. The demon reminds Tanjiro about all the people who are dead, leaving no one left to return home to. But that does not deter Tanjiro, who finally remembers his family and the love they gave him when they were alive. Muzan tries the only trick he has left. He tells Tanjiro that he killed Nezuko. But even in this limbo-esque space, Tanjiro can tell he is lying. And the belief in that pushes him upwards, his deceased family also aiding to lift him away from Muzan's hold. But it is not enough to keep the demon at bay. He insists now that he has hurt his friends and comrades. That he'd be better off here and not going to see them because they hate him now. Regardless, Tanjiro insists he must make amends for what he has done. He needs to apologize to them face to face. And though Muzan tries to keep him down, he pushes through, smelling their worry even from here, and needing to see them again. At last, a full-bodied Muzan appears, his cold stare matching his words. Silence. You are the inheritor of my will. Not unlike the anger and aggression he used on his upper-ranked demons, Muzan tugs on Tanjiro's hair to get him to listen and obey his commands. But Tanjiro ignores his worries about dying due to manifesting the mark. His eyes are looking forward beyond Muzan. While the demon tells him to live forever, Tanjiro only wants to be human and die like anyone else. He wants to see and be with everyone he cares about. With more harsh words not only insulting Tanjiro but accusing him of being selfish, Tanjiro's will begins to chip away, tears falling from his eyes. He isn't alone though. Never. Not wanting him to give in, his fallen comrades, Rengoku, Gyomei, Genya, Muichiro, Shinobu, Obenai, and Kanroji prop him up and help lead him upwards encouraging him to be free of this tug of war. Finally, smelling wisteria and freedom so close that he can nearly touch it, two arms reach through and take hold of him from above. Tanjiro grasps that hand firmly, realizing it's Nezuko. Muzan's hold refuses to loosen though, gripping him by the head and body, trying to drag him back down. With a final push, Tanjiro knows he is doing the right thing despite all the others who lost their lives. They knew what their work entailed. They wanted to save others and risk themselves for that cause. If anything, they would want him to be happy now that he can be. Knowing he won't win, Muzan is but a torso clinging onto a rising Tanjiro, floating upwards as if going to heaven. More hands join Nezuko's, keeping Tanjiro on the right path, leading him to them and away from Muzan's desperate pleas for survival. With a final pull, Muzan can no longer reach him or get through to him, and Tanjiro feels as if surrounded by flower petals as he slowly opens his eyes. Once he can see, there are over a dozen people around him, including Nezuko at his side. The first word he hears is his name from his sister's lips, his now human sister. And seeing her injured, more than anything pushes Tanjiro to tears as he apologizes for hurting her. Everyone suddenly cheers at that. Tanjiro is back to normal. Inosuke blubbers next to him trying to put on a brave face when it is clear how worried he was from the tears slipping through his mask. A moment later, Zenitsu vows to make Tanjiro pay for hurting his wife, which clearly catches Nezuko off guard. Gyu wobbles in place as the relief overcomes his body, and his injuries catch up with him. A beautifully touching embrace is shared between the siblings as they begin to cry, but with happiness this time around. Nearby, Kanao is informed about the medicine having worked and turned Tanjiro back to normal. She watches Tanjiro with tears in her eyes as he smiles back, with Inosuke clinging to him like a child. And you know what? Yushiro could not hold back his tears either, so glad for Tanjiro's return, but also carrying a great sadness for Tamayo's loss as he cradles her pin. At last, it is over. For real this time. As always, I'm Slice of Otaku. Thank you all so much for watching and have an awesome day.
